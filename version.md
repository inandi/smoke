Objective:  This feature is designed to support users in their smoking cessation efforts by 
providing a comprehensive progress tracking tool.
Functionality: User Input: Users will be able to input the following data points:
    Start Year: The year the user began smoking.
    Daily Cigarette Count: The average number of cigarettes smoked per day.
    Cost per Cigarette: The individual cost of each cigarette.
Progress Tracking: Based on the user-provided data, the system will calculate various metrics 
to illustrate progress over time. The specific calculation logic for these metrics 
is currently under development (TBD).
Penalty System: This feature will include an optional penalty system (functionality 
and impact to be determined) designed to further discourage smoking behavior. Users will have the
option to add penalties to their progress, potentially increasing motivation to stay smoke-free.
Development Status: This feature is currently in development.
